<h2>Introduction</h2>
<h2>Critical Field Resistance</h2>
<p>It is that value of the field resistance at which the D.C. shunt generator will fail to excite.</p>
<h2><br /> Critical Speed</h2>
<p>It is that speed for which the given shunt field resistance becomes the critical field resistance. Critical<br /> field resistance is obtained by plotting the OCC as in fig.2 and determining the slope of the tangent to the<br /> linear position of the curve from the origin. While drawing the tangent, the initial position of the O.C.C is<br /> neglected.<br /> Due to residual magnetism in the poles some EMF is generated even when If = 0. Hence the curve starts a<br /> little way up. The slight curvature at the lower end is due to magnetic inertia. It is seen that in the first<br /> part of the curve is practically straight. Hence the flux and the consequently the generated EMF is directly<br /> proportional to the exciting current. However at the higher flux densities where it is small iron path<br /> reluctance becomes appreciable and straight.Field windings are connected parallel to the armature and it<br /> is called DC shunt generator. Due to residual magnetism some initial emf and hence some current will be<br /> generated. This current while passing into the field coils will strengthen the magnetism of poles. This will<br /> increase pole flux which will further increase the generated emf. Increased emf and flux proceeds till<br /> equilibrium reached. This reinforcement of emf and flux proceeds till equilibrium reached at some point.<br /> GRAPH between If and Eg* :</p>
